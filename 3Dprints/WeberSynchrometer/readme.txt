The two halves are printed individually and then glued together.  
This prevents supports during printing.  
The half that inserts into the carburetor needs to be flipped 180 degrees in the slicer.

The fit of the insert was validated in two new carburetors and one very old.  
Your milage may very!

One last thing.  This fits but I have not yet tested that it works as intended.  My car is not running!
