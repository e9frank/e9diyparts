When making the circuit board use 2oz copper not 1oz!  

This version of the fuse block and circuit board are for an early E9.  I believe this is considered to be an E3 fuse block.

There are 6 parts to making this fuse block.

1. Blade connectors. Need about 50
2. Fuse connectors.  Need about 20
3. M2x4 screw.       Need 8
4. M2 threaded inserts. Need 8
5. Circuit board.  Just 1 but more is better.
6. ABS 3D printed fuse block.  Just 1 but filament matters.  
Optionally, a printed color card to match the original.

If you look at the parts folder you will see I ordered much more than needed.  If the circuit board is done through a group buy you can easily get the board for less than $3 each.  The Digikey parts can be had for about $30 which includes shipping.  

Having a heated insert tool may help.  However, I have also pushed them in with just the soldering iron tip.  

I printed the fuse block many times trying to get the correct shape.  I also experimented with different filaments.  I thought ABS with carbon fiber would be good because it leaves a nice texture.  But no, it was very brittle and warped allot.  Plain ABS had the best results. The eSun ABS+ worked best for no warping.  Polymaker ABS printed best but warped.  If your not concerned about heat in the car PETG prints very well but it leaves a very glossy surface.  The picture with the back color panel is the final version using eSun ABS with little warping.  

I do not have a fuse cover so it is doubtful that it will fit.  The next time I buy parts from Wallothnesch I plan on getting the cover and updating the fuse block.  

From what I have found on the web about current capacities it appears that the circuit board should be capable of handling the 25A load.  However, I am not an expert on this and could be misreading the information.  Do your own research.  As stated above, use at your own risk.
