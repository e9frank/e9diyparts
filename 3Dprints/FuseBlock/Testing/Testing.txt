While testing I was able to blow up to a 15A fuse.
The AC side went up to 2.2A which should be over 20A but it did not blow the 20A fuse.
At 2.2A at 120v AC the connector was 150F after running for a few minutes.  The inverter is supposedly rated at 500W but it definitely cannot produce that.  In fact, it only could do about 300W.

The copper on both sides of the board should be able to support about 50A as long as its properly soldered on both sides.

Included in the testing folder are calculations from the web that show that 25A can be done with the copper traces.  

If you decide to use these parts it's at your own risk.
